What is the Shadowing :-
	Block Scoping: To understand shadowing in JavaScript, we need to be clear with the scope first. In computer programming languages, Scope is a certain section/region of the program where a defined variable can have its existence and can be recognized, beyond that it can’t be accessed. In JavaScript, a Block is a compound statement that is defined by curly braces {} and used to combine multiple statements into one statement where JavaScript expects only one statement. And all the variables and functions that can be accessed inside a block are said to be inside that block scope, hence called Block scoped.
For example, let and const variables are stored in separate memory space, so it is called block-scoped but var variables can be accessed outside the block as it is stored in the Global object memory space, hence it is called Global scoped.
Shadowing: Now, when a variable is declared in a certain scope having the same name defined on its outer scope and when we call the variable from the inner scope, the value assigned to the variable in the inner scope is the value that will be stored in the variable in the memory space. This is known as Shadowing or Variable Shadowing. In JavaScript, the introduction of let and const in ECMAScript 6 along with block scoping allows variable shadowing.
	Example : function func() {
	let a = ABC;
	if (true) {
		let a = 'XYZ'; // New value assigned
		console.log(a);
	}
	console.log(a);
func();
Output :
	XYZ;
	ABC;
 
Illegal Shadowing: Now, while shadowing a variable, it should not cross the boundary of the scope, i.e. we can shadow var variable by let variable but cannot do the opposite. So, if we try to shadow let variable by var variable, it is known as Illegal Shadowing and it will give the error as “variable is already defined.” 
Example : function func() {
var a = 'Geeks';
	let b = ‘ABC’;
	if (true) {
		let a = ‘Hello’; // Legal Shadowing
		var b = “XYZ; // Illegal Shadowing
		console.log(a); // It will print 'GeeksforGeeks'
		console.log(b); // It will print error
	}
}
func();
Output :
	Identifier 'b' has already been declared
